## Glossary

* **Luminosity** (instantaneous): the number of collisions per cross section per time
* **Luminosity** (integrated): the sum of the instantaneous luminosity over time, a measure of data collected, often given in units of cross section such as $$ \mathrm{fb}^{-1} $$
* **BRIL**: The Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity (BRIL) group in CMS, responsible for luminosity measurements
* `brilcalc`: the command-line tool provided and maintained by the CMS BRIL group for calculating luminosity
